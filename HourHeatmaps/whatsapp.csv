2017-05-02,18,Linda,"i'm not sure. i think life is just this. boring repetitive loop. but i've always known that. even even so, i've always looked forward to this time in my life (career, apartment, freedom, no obligations etc). and it my dream come true for a few months. but now it's just like ""now what"". when i didn't have this, o was sad because i didn't have the one thing i thought i wanted. but now that i do, and this is daily life, it's just become so monotmous. i don't have any more goals. i'm not even that motivated try hard at work because it's not like it'll get me anywhere meaningful. maybe it'll get me promoted early. which used to motivate me. but most likely not. which is fine because i'll either find a new job next year or get promoted next year automatically even if i just do the bare minimum. so it's like i'm just wasting 8 hours a day sitting and being bored and reflecting on how meaningless life is and how i have no more goals. which makes me super depressed coming home. which makes me feel like i have to have weed to feel better. which makes me even more depressed about life upon retrospection because i feel like i'm becoming dependent on weed. but maybe that's okay? like if i just accept my life as it is now, and npt worry about how i have no passion or joy or motivation, then i'll be less sad about life. maybe i'm seeking validation that passing each day meaninglessly is okay?",MESSAGE,1,265

2017-07-09,16,Linda,"i don't think trump supporters have any particular views on policy (foreign or domestic). they're moved only by a nihilistic hatred of liberals. whatever riles them up is their bread and butter. they feel they've been mocked and ridiculed by popular culture (and that is half unfair and half deserved). so they are in the process of getting back at everyone. they elected trump *because* he's a pig, because he can lay the biggest and steamiest piles on that mainstream culture. you have to pay attention, but if you follow interviews of trump supporters, you will eventually notice that, from news clip to news clip, the one comment that comes back often is the one where the supporter will say something along the lines: ""i like it when trump shakes the media a little bit"". these are the hardcore trump fans. sadly, the moderates are not far off. the stupidity of this situation is that everybody gets fooled. trump first. because he doesn't like his supporters (let's be real: this guy wouldn't wipe his ass with the hillbillies that follow him). but he thinks they like him. they don't. they elected him to do one thing: being a dick, especially to the liberal side of america. eventually, trump will get tired of being the people's monkey. and the people are getting fooled too. some, i think, imagine trump can both play the part and fix their lives. i don't believe their reasons to believe that are very sophisticated. you can narrow it to one thing: trump is a billionaire so he must ""know money"", as one trump supporter put it. the thing is he doesn't, his business track record proves it. i remember the speech of michael bloomberg at the dnc convention. he said: ""trump says he wants to run america like he runs his business. god help us!"". so trump supporters won't get any out of him. what they are getting instead is the republican agenda which, as far as i can remember, as always been about making sure poor people are miserable as hell. in the end, everybody will get tired of this farce. the administration is testing the limits of how far lies can go. but even stupidity as its limits sometimes. people will see that things aren't getting better and it will erode their patience and diminish their confidence. trump too will tire of being the circus act. he'll realize he's the clown and not the show runner. he's gonna find himself in the situation of the performer who sees his audience getting bored and dwindle when he strays from his main trick. that will hurt his ego badly, his ego being, as we know, his soft spot. and beyond that, i think he did not anticipate that the press would be all up in his junk, asking for tax returns and peeling apart every shred of his business. if reporters start getting really specific about the underbelly of his so called empire trump will get super squeamish. the tax returns in particular are a big no no. i don't think they'll show anything nefarious (they're tax returns after all), but i do believe they'll show he's not a billionaire, or at least that his wealth is vastly inflated. he's for sure very rich, but he's not *super* rich. if that became public, it would take a lot away from the trump persona, at least in his eyes. remember, he's the guy who sued because someone called him a millionaire (instead of a ""billionaire""), as if that was somehow an insult. the suit may be a stunt, but the message is quite clear. the sum total of this is, i think, that trump will drop the presidency like a hot potatoe. all this, of course, will take time. by then, as you said, it will be too late for people to realize that they have not only shot themselves in the foot but sawed their own legs off. it will be a hard reckoning and i can't think of how people will react. maybe it will be very quiet suddenly, like when you turn the light off somewhere. but that's in the distance. for now, we have to get used to the noise. and, by god, we have to get better at parsing through that noise, to distinguish what is just people yelling and what is the loud cracks of the system crashing. because when trump is gone, and his supporters have followed him in that pit of shame and oblivion, we'll have a heavy work ahead of us. so we'd better start now to save on the sweat waiting for us. edit: holy moses! thanks for the gold!",MESSAGE,1,783

2017-07-21,10,Linda,"next, i'm angry because you're so irresponsible with drinking. like as a 40 year old man who's been drinking for over a decade, you should not be getting black out drunk as often as you do, unless it's actually becoming a problem. why can't you just have a handful or so of drinks with friends like a handful of times a month??",MESSAGE,1,62
